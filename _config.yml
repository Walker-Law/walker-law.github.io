  Hi! I'm Walker, a physics and mathematics major at Coe College. 
  My professional goal is to work in a national laboratory studying nuclear or 
  high-energy physics. After Coe, I plan to pursue a PhD in high-energy physics 
  to reach this dream. Welcome to my website!

          Calibrated and simulated novel scintillators for FLASH RT cancer treatment. 
          The goal of this project is to create a 3D dosimetry model that utilizes artificial 
          intelligence and prototype real-time radiation dosage integration for FLASH RT cancer treatment.

      I love photography, ice skating, hockey, skateboarding, and philosophy. 
      Some of my work is on my Fliker page that I've linked up top. Feel free to check it out!

      I also enjoy opera, classical literature, and art of all kinds. Let me know if you have any recommendations!
