  Hi! My name is Walker, and I'm a first-generation undergraduate student at Coe College pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Physics and Mathematics. I have a strong interest in many fields of physics, having performed research in observational astrophysics, computational and experimental particle physics, medical physics, material science, and nuclear physics. I also enjoy spreading knowledge, a love for physics, and science literacy through tutoring and teaching. After my undergraduate degree, I plan to pursue a Ph.D. in High Energy or Nuclear Physics.

        description: Optimized kinematic measurements of the Super High Momentum Spectrometer (SHMS) and High Momentum Spectrometer
          (HMS) for future studies of deuteron electro-disintegration studies. Created Python code for use of optimization methods
          for general experiments. This research project was an REU at The Catholic University of America in the summer of 2025.

          Created and calibrated polystyrene-based scintillators via experiment and Monte Carlos simulations
          for use in FLASH RT cancer treatment. The goal of this project is to create a 3D dosimetry model that utilizes artificial 
          intelligence and prototype real-time radiation dosage integration for FLASH RT cancer treatment.

          Produced many samples of sodium borate glass disks with varying molar percentage of sodium oxide.
          These molded samples were sent to Seton Hall University for testing, where the disks would be placed between
          capacitor-like electrodes for testing of their effectiveness at producing low-temperature microplasma.

      I love photography, ice skating, hockey, skateboarding, and philosophy. 
      Some of my work is on my Fliker page that I've linked up top. Feel free to check it out!

      I also enjoy opera, classical literature, and art of all kinds.
