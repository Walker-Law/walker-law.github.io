          Calibrated and simulated novel scintillators for FLASH RT cancer treatment. 
          Goal will be to create a 3D dosimetry model that utilizes artificial intelligence 
          and prototype real-time radiation dosage integration for FLASH RT cancer treatment.

      I love photography, ice skating, hockey, skateboarding, and philosophy. 
      Some of my work is on my Fliker page that I've linked at the top of the 
      page. Feel free to check it out!

      I also enjoy opera and classical literature.
